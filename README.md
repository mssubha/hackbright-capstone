1) Shopping List :

    Create a shopping list web application in which the user can add items to the shopping list. When the user is heading out to a particular store, the user will be able to pull list of items that can be purchased in the store. The database with a list of store and items avaialble in each store will be created by the user. An interesring feature that could be added to this project is using a map API that shows stores closer to each other and generate a shopping plan based on it.


2) Carpool Planner :

     Create a carpool planner for kids to go to school. Parents should enter basic information about the school, detials about their carp and any other preferences when their child carpools. Using a mapping API, the application should suggest who can be carpool buddies from the database of parents who have registered to carpool. Additional feature that could be implemented is sending messages through mobile phones to tha carpool group. 
     

3) Garden Plants Monitoring :
    
      When the user adds a new plant to the garden, name of the plant will be entered to the web app. Basic information about the plant should be pulled from a plants data API. The user can set up a watering/ fertilizing reminder for each plants that will send notification to the mobile phone.
